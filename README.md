            <h1>Hey there, <span class="green-text">,</span> I'm Rishad</h1>
            <p>I am currently a full-time Technology Management student at Ontario Tech University. From a young age, 
                I have been deeply fascinated by technology, starting with button phones and progressing to touch screen phones with unimaginable options and features. The rapid evolution of technology in recent years has been both fascinating and exciting, fueling my passion for the field even further. In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy coding in my free time.
                 I like playing sports, and traveling, which helps me maintain a balanced and active lifestyle.,</p>
